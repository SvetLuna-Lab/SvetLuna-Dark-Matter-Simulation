# 🌌 SvetLuna — Dark Matter Simulation
*A minimal, reproducible project for synthetic-field modeling, 2D spectra, and resonance-driven anomaly detection.*

---

## Overview
This repository simulates **dark-matter–inspired fields** and studies their spectral structure:
1) generate synthetic fields (1/f “pink” noise + shaped components),  
2) compute **2D PSD** and radial spectra,  
3) detect anomalies via **Local Outlier Factor (LOF)**,  
4) export artifacts (PNG/CSV/NPY) for analysis.

The design is deliberately minimal and fully reproducible.
